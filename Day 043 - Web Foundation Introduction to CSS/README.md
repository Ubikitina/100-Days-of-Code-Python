# Day 43 - Web Foundations: Introduction to CSS

This folder contains the materials and exercises for Day 43 of learning Python, where I was introduced to the basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). The focus was on understanding how to style HTML documents using CSS, including different methods of applying CSS and using various selectors to target HTML elements. The Color Vocab Project allowed me to apply my CSS skills in a practical, hands-on project.

## Files and Directories

### Root Directory

- **index.html**: A basic HTML file demonstrating inline CSS with a red background.

### 5.1 Adding CSS

This section explores three different methods of adding CSS to an HTML document: Inline, Internal, and External CSS.

- **index.html**: A navigation page linking to examples of the three methods of adding CSS.
- **inline.html**: Demonstrates adding CSS inline within the HTML elements. The text "Style Me in Blue!" is styled directly within the `h1` tag.
- **internal.html**: Demonstrates internal CSS by using a `<style>` tag in the head of the HTML document. The text "Style Me in Red!" is styled using CSS within the HTML document.
- **external.html**: Demonstrates external CSS by linking to an external stylesheet. The text "Style Me in Green!" is styled using an external CSS file.
- **style.css**: The external stylesheet that defines the CSS used in `external.html`.
