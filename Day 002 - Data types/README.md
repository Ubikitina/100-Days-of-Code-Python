# Day 2: Python Basics - Data types

On Day 2, we focused on understanding and manipulating different data types in Python, performing basic calculations, and validating user input. Here's a summary of the exercises:

## Files and Their Purposes

1. [01-data-types.py](./01-data-types.py): Calculate the sum of the digits in a two-digit number provided by the user. The script ensures that the input is a valid two-digit number and computes the sum of its digits.

2. [02-bmi.py](./02-bmi.py): Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the user's height and weight. It converts the input to floats, performs the BMI calculation, and prints the result as an integer.

3. [03-life-in-weeks.py](./03-life-in-weeks.py): Estimate the remaining days, weeks, and months of life based on the user's current age, assuming a lifespan of 90 years. The script calculates these values and prints them if the age input is valid.

4. [04-tip-calculator.py](./04-tip-calculator.py): Calculate the tip amount and split the total bill among a specified number of people. The script includes input validation for the bill amount, tip percentage, and the number of people, and provides the amount each person should pay.
