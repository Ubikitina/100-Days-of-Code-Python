# Day 13: Debugging Exercises

Welcome to Day 13 of your Python learning journey! Today, I focused on debugging techniques to identify and fix issues in Python code. Below is an overview of the files I created and the exercises I completed to enhance your debugging skills.

## Files in This Folder

### 01-exercise0.py

This file contains a series of debugging exercises where you fixed common errors in Python code.

- **Key Exercises**:
  - **Exercise 1**: Fixed a range issue in a loop to ensure it includes the upper limit.
  - **Exercise 2**: Corrected an index error when accessing a list with random numbers.
  - **Exercise 3**: Fixed condition checks to properly identify different age groups.
  - **Exercise 4**: Resolved type and indentation errors for user age input and output.
  - **Exercise 5**: Corrected assignment errors in variable declarations and calculations.
  - **Exercise 6**: Fixed indentation and list appending errors in a function that processes a list.

### 02-exercise1.py

- **Key Bug**: Fixed an issue in a leap year checker function where the conditions and logic were not correctly identifying leap years.
- **Buggy Code**:
  - Conditions for leap year checks were incorrect and needed adjustment.
- **Corrected Code**:
  - Adjusted conditions to properly check for leap years based on standard rules.

### 03-exercise2.py

- **Key Bug**: Fixed the FizzBuzz program logic to correctly identify and print "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" for numbers 1 through 100.
- **Buggy Code**:
  - Incorrectly used `if` statements and `print` statements leading to improper output.
- **Corrected Code**:
  - Utilized `elif` for proper conditional checks and printing.

## How to Use

1. **Review the Code**:
   - Open each file to review the original buggy code and its fixed version. Each file demonstrates different debugging scenarios and their solutions.

2. **Run the Scripts**:
   - To test the corrected code, execute the Python scripts by running `python <filename>.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

3. **Practice Debugging**:
   - Use these exercises to practice identifying and fixing bugs in your own code. The skills you learn from these exercises are essential for effective debugging.
