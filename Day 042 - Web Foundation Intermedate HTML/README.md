# Day 41: Introduction to HTML - Web Foundations

Welcome to Day 41 of learning Python! Today, we took a detour from Python to explore the basics of web development, specifically focusing on HTML (HyperText Markup Language). We covered several foundational topics, and the exercises helped solidify the concepts by creating and understanding different HTML elements.

In this session, I got hands-on experience with basic HTML elements:
- **List Elements:** Created ordered and unordered lists to organize content.
- **Nesting and Indentation:** Learned how to properly nest HTML elements and indent your code for readability.
- **Anchor Elements:** Added hyperlinks to web pages using anchor tags (`<a>`).
- **Image Elements:** Embedded images into your webpage using the `<img>` tag.
- **Project:** Combined all these elements to create a simple birthday invitation page.
