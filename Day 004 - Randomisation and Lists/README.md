# Day 4: Randomisation and Lists

In this project, we explore the concepts of randomisation and list manipulation in Python. By practicing these exercises, we gain hands-on experience with the random module and learn to work with lists effectively.

## Files and Their Purposes

- **[01-heads-or-tails.py](./01-heads-or-tails.py)**: Simulates a coin toss to randomly return "Heads" or "Tails".
  - **Key Learnings**:
    - Using the `random` module to generate random numbers.
    - Basic conditional statements (`if-else`) to print different messages based on the random number.

- **[02-banker-roulette.py](./02-banker-roulette.py)**: Randomly selects a person from a list to pay for a meal.
  - **Key Learnings**:
    - Splitting a string into a list using the `split` method.
    - Using `random.randint` to select a random index from the list.

- **[03-treasure-map.py](./03-treasure-map.py)**: Creates a simple grid-based map where the user can place a "treasure" by specifying coordinates.
  - **Key Learnings**:
    - Understanding and manipulating nested lists (lists within lists).
    - Converting user input into coordinates to update a grid.

- **[04-rock-paper-scissors.py](./04-rock-paper-scissors.py)**: Implements the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where a user plays against the computer.
  - **Key Learnings**:
    - Using functions to modularize code for better readability and reusability.
    - Using conditional statements to determine the winner of the game based on the choices made by the user and the computer.
    - Representing game choices with multi-line strings for better user experience.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Randomisation**:
  - Generating random numbers using the `random` module.
  - Applying randomness to simulate real-world scenarios (e.g., coin toss, selecting a person from a list).

- **Lists**:
  - Creating and manipulating lists.
  - Understanding nested lists and how to access and modify their elements.

- **Conditional Statements**:
  - Using `if-else` and `if-elif-else` statements to handle different conditions and outcomes.

- **Functions**:
  - Defining functions to encapsulate logic and improve code organization.
  - Calling functions and passing arguments to them.
