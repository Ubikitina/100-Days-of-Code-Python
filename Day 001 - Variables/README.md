# Day 1: Python Basics - Variables

Welcome to the first day of the 100 Days of Code Python challenge! In this initial day, we focused on understanding basic Python functionalities such as printing output, debugging simple code, handling user input, and working with variables.

## Created Python scripts

- [01-printing.py](./01-printing.py): This script introduces the `print` function in Python. It demonstrates how to use `print` to display strings and includes examples of syntax.

- [02-debugging.py](./02-debugging.py): In this file, we fixed some code related to string manipulation. The goal was to correct the code to properly demonstrate string concatenation and newline creation.

- [03-input.py](./03-input.py): This script prompts the user to input their name and then prints the length of the input string.

- [04-variables.py](./04-variables.py): Here, we practiced swapping the values of two variables. The provided code initializes two variables with user input and then swaps their values.

- [05-band-name-generator.py](./05-band-name-generator.py): This script is a simple interactive program that helps users generate a band name. It combines the city they grew up in with their petâ€™s name to create a band name.
