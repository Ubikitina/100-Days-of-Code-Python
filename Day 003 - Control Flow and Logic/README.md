# Day 3: Python Basics - Control Flows and Logic
By practicing these exercises, we will gain practical experience with control flow constructs, which are essential for building complex logic and interactive programs in Python.


## Files and Their Purposes

- **[01-odd-or-even.py](./01-odd-or-even.py)** Determining if a number is odd or even. Key Learnings:
  - Basic conditional statements (`if-else`) to print different messages based on the condition.

- **[02-bmi-2.0.py](./02-bmi-2.0.py)** Calculating and interpreting BMI (Body Mass Index). Key Learnings:
  - Use of conditional statements (`if-elif-else`) to interpret BMI values and provide feedback.

- **[03-leap-year.py](./03-leap-year.py)** Checking if a year is a leap year. Key Learnings:
  - Understanding the rules for determining leap years:
    - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
    - However, if the year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
  - Use of nested conditional statements to implement these rules.

- **[04-pizza-order.py](./04-pizza-order.py)** Calculating the total cost of a customized pizza order. Key Learnings:
  - Use of conditional statements to calculate the total bill based on user choices for pizza size, pepperoni, and extra cheese.
  - Basic string concatenation to display the final bill.

- **[05-love-calculator.py](./05-love-calculator.py)** Calculating a "love score" based on names. Key Learnings:
  - Counting occurrences of specific letters in strings (using the `count` method and `sum` function).
  - Use of conditional statements to print different messages based on the love score.

- **[06-treasure-island.py](./06-treasure-island.py)** Creating an interactive text-based adventure game. Key Learnings:
  - Using nested conditional statements to create a branching storyline.
  - Handling multiple possible outcomes and providing feedback to the user.
