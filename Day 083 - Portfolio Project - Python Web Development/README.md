## Implementation
I've crafted this portfolio using a template downloaded from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/creative). The template is licensed under the MIT License, more details can be found in the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-creative/blob/master/LICENSE).

The website is powered by Flask and Python, providing a dynamic and interactive experience.

## Reflection Time
Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

### Today's learnings

1. **Building a Website from Scratch:**
   - Explored the process of creating a website from the ground up, gaining insights into web development.

2. **Using Bootstrap Templates:**
   - Learned to leverage Bootstrap templates for efficient website development.
   - Emphasized the importance of selecting suitable templates, ensuring compliance with licenses and terms of use.

3. **Practicing UX/UI Learnings:**
   - Engaged in practical exercises to reinforce User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design principles.
   - Explored techniques to enhance the overall usability and aesthetics of web interfaces.

4. **Using Python and Flask Library:**

   - Explored the capabilities of Flask for building dynamic and interactive web applications.


### Potential improvements for the future
In reflecting on today's project, I've identified some areas for potential improvement:

- **Limited Portfolio Projects:**
  - Realized that my current portfolio lacks a sufficient number of projects to showcase on my website. I could undertake some other side-projects to enhance my portfolio's depth and diversity.

- **Test the Responsive Design:**
  - Although the website has been created from a template, I have not tested it on different devices. I should test the website optimization for different devices and screen sizes.

- **SEO Optimization:**
  - Investigate and implement Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques to improve the website's visibility on search engines. This can include optimizing content, meta tags, and ensuring a mobile-friendly experience.
