# Day 5: Loops

In this project, we focus on mastering loops in Python. These exercises provide practice with `for` loops and help in understanding how to iterate over data structures and perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

## Files and Their Purposes

- **[01-average-height.py](./01-average-height.py)**: Calculates the average height of students from a list of heights.
  - **Key Learnings**:
    - Iterating through a list of numbers.
    - Summing values and counting elements without using built-in `len()` and `sum()` functions.

- **[02-high-score.py](./02-high-score.py)**: Determines the highest score from a list of student scores.
  - **Key Learnings**:
    - Iterating through a list to find the maximum value without using the `max()` function.
    - Comparing values and updating the highest score as needed.

- **[03-adding-even-numbers.py](./03-adding-even-numbers.py)**: Computes the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.
  - **Key Learnings**:
    - Using a loop to iterate over a range of numbers.
    - Identifying even numbers using modulo operations and summing them.

- **[04-fizzbuzz.py](./04-fizzbuzz.py)**: Implements the FizzBuzz problem, printing numbers from 1 to 100 with specific substitutions.
  - **Key Learnings**:
    - Handling multiple conditions in a loop.
    - Printing different outputs based on divisibility by 3 and 5.

- **[05-password-generator.py](./05-password-generator.py)**: Generates a random password with a specified number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
  - **Key Learnings**:
    - Using loops to generate a sequence of random characters.
    - Shuffling a list to randomize the order of characters in the password.
